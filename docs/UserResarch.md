Nothing as of Now





## Elton 
Most respondents do not currently create or send invoices or estimates themselves, often citing that the task is either not part of their responsibilities or handled by someone else (e.g., a parent or employer).

Among those who do create or send client documents, the following tools were mentioned:
	•	Google Docs / Gmail – for drafting and sending invoices or estimates informally.
	•	Microsoft Word & Excel – for creating professional documents and converting them into PDF format.
	•	PDF editors and templates – for quick customization and sharing.
	•	AI or online tools (e.g., ChatGPT) – for generating or formatting content when needed.
Greg:
- Observation: Albiet we didn't get any initial responses from people in our target demographic, non-english speakers still showed a lot of interest and gave very good feedback.
- Supporting data: 3 survey results showed people with non-english speaking families. Their specific feedback gave good points for specifying our focus
