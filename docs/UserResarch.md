#### Observation - Features to Implement for Non-Tech Savy Audience Thomas 
##### Observation Statement:
- Many people tend to think that people who are not tech savvy tend to struggle the most with UI navigation and aspects like 2FA
- Navigation from page to page and understanding how they are linked is another observation by someone in IT work 
##### Supporting Data 
- There were 15 total responders in the survey, 33% of responders answered something along the lines of UI/Navigation problems (this is before throwing out bad/meaningless responses.)
- Second concern mentioned the most is 2FA, but not nearly as much 
##### Team Action 
- UI must be developed with the goal in mind of making navigation extremely simple for the users because users will not be tech savvy
- 2FA has some innate level of being difficult, there's not much that can be done other than instructions and maybe a little help guide

## Elton 
Most respondents do not currently create or send invoices or estimates themselves, often citing that the task is either not part of their responsibilities or handled by someone else (e.g., a parent or employer).

Among those who do create or send client documents, the following tools were mentioned:
•	Google Docs / Gmail – for drafting and sending invoices or estimates informally.
•	Microsoft Word & Excel – for creating professional documents and converting them into PDF format.
•	PDF editors and templates – for quick customization and sharing.
•	AI or online tools (e.g., ChatGPT) – for generating or formatting content when needed.

## Greg:
- Observation: Albiet we didn't get any initial responses from people in our target demographic, non-english speakers still showed a lot of interest and gave very good feedback.
- Supporting data: 3 survey results showed people with non-english speaking families. Their specific feedback gave good points for specifying our focus

## Jack:
#### Observation: 
- A general lack of tech-savvyness is the most critical piece of making software for an older crowd
- Struggling with things that are common on apps nowadays are a number 1 priority to make more accessible, like 2FA.
#### Survey Responses
- A chunk of survey responses highlighted issues with the aforementioned issues
- The main problem area wasn't 2FA, but instead UX and UI implementation being easy to use for both young people and older users
#### Solutions
- The main solution is to make an easily navigatable UI for the older crowd of our users, with obvious functions across the app that are easy to use and understand
- To follow this, potentially creating a user-help guide for the app to begin with could help, and showing a demo video showcasing the app in use
