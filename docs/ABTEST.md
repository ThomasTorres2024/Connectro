Test 1: Translated Documents Screen Placement
- US # ???
- Measures average number of documents created by active users per day
- Hypothesis: having the Translated Documents screen in a settings/profile page as well as being able to see newly translated documents, after a translation, will result in a greater number of average documents created by active users per day.
- About 10-15% of users will be able to see the experiment. Adding an extra way to view Translated Documents on paper sounds like a good quality of life feature. Although it may not be completely necessary and may have no impact on user retention. If anything, the app is designed to thrive on ease of use and thus, more buttons and screens may actually harm user retention.
- Variations: ???
