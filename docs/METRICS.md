* Daily/Monthly/Weekly Active Users (Thomas) - Firebase automatically measures the number of unique users that have used our application over the period of a day, month, and week.
* Number of Documents Created Per Day (Thomas) - When the user gets to the last translate screen, when they finally press translate, Flutterflow will send a request to Firebase to record each of these from all given users. 
* Average Documents Created by Active Users a Day (Thomas) - When the user gets to the last translate screen, when they finally press translate, Flutterflow will send a request to Firebase to record the total number of requests sent that day, and divide it by the total number of active users. 
* Number of references (Elton)
- Why Engagement? Because references indicate users’ willingness to use advanced features and remain active beyond core translation.
- Why Metric Matters? It shows how valuable users find the reference functionality — if it’s increasing, engagement quality is improving.
