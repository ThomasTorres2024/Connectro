* Daily/Monthly/Weekly Active Users (Thomas) - Firebase automatically measures the number of unique users that have used our application over the period of a day, month, and week.
* Number of Documents Created Per Day (Thomas) - When the user gets to the last translate screen, when they finally press translate, Flutterflow will send a request to Firebase to record each of these from all given users. 
* Average Documents Created by Active Users a Day (Thomas) - When the user gets to the last translate screen, when they finally press translate, Flutterflow will send a request to Firebase to record the total number of requests sent that day, and divide it by the total number of active users. 
* Number of references (Elton)
- Why Engagement? Because references indicate users’ willingness to use advanced features and remain active beyond core translation.
- Why Metric Matters? It shows how valuable users find the reference functionality — if it’s increasing, engagement quality is improving.
- New users in new demographics: The combined data of the profiles in the app collecting data about the user and the documents they're translating (from starting language to target language), we can infer what kind of demographics are picking up on using the app (Jack)
- Sharing the app on social media: Using public analytics from social medias and google to keep track of how often the app is shared or talked about, and the groups of people talking about it, along with the nature of their conversations/feedback (Jack)
